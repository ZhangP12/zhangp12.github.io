		<p>If you've read the About Me section, you will know I am really into learning. Although almost anything is fascinating to me,
		I am particuarly interested in the field of biology. I own this huge textbook called Campbell Biology, which contains
		in-depth information on everything from genetics to ecology to cellular structure. When I have free time, I devour as much
		information as I can and try to figure out the why the particular area of biology I am reading about works the way it does.
		To me, biology is the most intriguing of all the different sciences, because it attempts to explore the very nature of life,
		its interactions, how it began, and so much more. Inundating my brain with knowledge excites it, especially if it makes me think.
		Biology does that the best.
		<br>Besides being a really fun and interesting activity, reading this gigantic book also prepares me for the USABO exam.
		USABO stands for United States of America Biology Olympiad, and is an organization that runs a national exam to select 4
		intelligent people from 20 finalists to participate in the International Biology Olympiad, or IBO.</p>
