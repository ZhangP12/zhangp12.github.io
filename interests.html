		<h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
			<p>Yeah, food is awesome. That's why I starting with food first. (Also because it's first on the website assignment).
			Just saying, I have absolutely no skill in cooking. I just happen to like food.</p>
			<h4>Omelettes</h4>
				<p>Eggs are awesome. Eggs with scrumptious stuff inside are even better. Every time my family stays at a hotel,
				I get omelettes for breakfast. Go eggs-with-stuff-inside! Sometimes I make it myself. It always tastes horrible.</p>

			<h4>Smoothies</h4>
				<p>Actually, it's my little brother who makes smoothies 99% of the time. I just take some. 
				The other 1% of the time I try to follow some online recipe. Those are predictable disasters. </p>

			<h4>Boba Milk Tea</h4>
				<p>Don't try making boba milk tea. There are lots of awesome places to go for boba.
				Try the link below. (It's been a long time since I had boba, so don't count on me to be an expert).</p>

		<h2>An Interesting Movie: The Lego Movie</h2>
			<p>The Lego Movie is an awesome movie, but this section is here mostly to complete the website assignment.</p>
			<h4>Wow, a Synopsis</h4>
				<p>Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary LEGO figurine who always follows the rules, is mistakenly identified as the Special -- an extraordinary being and the key to saving the world. 
				He finds himself drafted into a fellowship of strangers who are on a mission to stop an evil tyrant's (Will Ferrell) plans to conquer the world. 
				Unfortunately for Emmet, he is hopelessly -- and hilariously -- unprepared for such a task, but he'll give it his all nonetheless. </p>
			<h4>Trailer Video</h4>

			<h4>A Personal Review</h4>
				<p>The Lego Movie ranks among my favorites. The plot is very funny and contains many surprising twists and turns.
				Animation is very well done; it looks almost like a homemade stopmotion video (albeit 2 hours long).
				And so concludes my terrible review.</p>
		<h2>Favorite Mathematical Problem: Does P = NP?</h2>
			<p>The P versus NP problem is probably the most important problem in theoretical computer science, and ranks among the top in all areas of mathematics.
			It is one of the seven Millennium Problems, with one million US dollars given to the person(s) who solves one of those problems. To date, only the Poincaré conjecture has been solved. 
			<br>Informally, the P versus NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution that can be quickly verified can also be solved quickly.
			<h4>A Longer Explanation</h4>
				<p>The P versus NP problem concerns how quickly an algorithm can solve a problem given input n. 
				P stands for polynomial time, while NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time.
				<br>A P problem requires at worst x<sup>k</sup> time to solve, where x is "length" of the problem, while k is an integer. Hence the name polynomial time.
				NP problems ARE NOT the hard problems I was talking about. They're any problem whose solution can be verified quickly,
				which obviously includes P problems. NP-hard problems are, well, hard. They require k<sup>x</sup> time to solve (sometimes x!),
				so time grows exponentially as the length of the problem grows. That's really bad.
				<br>The Euler diagram below gives an idea of how the different classes of P and NP are related. (Note: Left side assumes P=NP, right side assumes P≠NP).</p>

			<h4>Additional Resources</h4>
				<p>Please take everything I wrote about the P versus NP problem with a grain of salt. I am not a computer scientist, and don't fully understand the mathematics,
				so I am not very qualified to give a lecture on this topic.
				<br>That being said, here are some additional resources if you would like to check them out:</p>
