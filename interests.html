		<h3> Favorite Foods </h3>
			<p>Yeah, food is awesome. That's why I starting with food first. (Also because it's first on the website assignment).
			Just saying, I have absolutely no skill in cooking. I just happen to like food.</p>
			<h4>Omelettes</h4>
				<p>Eggs are awesome. Eggs with scrumptious stuff inside are even better. Every time my family stays at a hotel,
				I get omelettes for breakfast. Go eggs-with-stuff-inside! Sometimes I make it myself. It always tastes horrible.</p>

			<h4>Smoothies</h4>
				</p>Actually, it's my little brother who makes smoothies 99% of the time. I just take some. 
				The other 1% of the time I try to follow some online recipe. Those are predictable disasters. </p>

			<h4>Boba Milk Tea</h4>
				<p>Don't try making boba milk tea. There are lots of awesome places to go for boba.
				Try the link below. (It's been a long time since I had boba, so don't count on me to be an expert).</p>
