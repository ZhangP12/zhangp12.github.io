		<p>Although there are a wide variety of different physicians (a.k.a. doctors), they all work to fix and preserve the
		health of people. According to US News, the median salary for physicians is $187,200 per year, ranking physicians
		as the 6th best payed job. Most physicians work in hospitals. They also work in high-stress environments, being responsible for the healths of patients and
		potentially being called to be on-duty at the hospital at any given time (depending on what kind of physician he/she is).</p>

		<h2>Becoming a Physician</h2>
			</p>Although physicians are paid very well, becoming a physician is extremely hard work, requiring the completion of medical
			school and residency. Although there are many different types of physicians, most work in high stress environments. This
			can be due to long work hours, an irregular schedule, responsibility for the patient, among many other things.
			Some physicians may also work outside, such as Doctors Without Borders, who deliver medical care in war-torn regions and 
			developing countries.</p>
