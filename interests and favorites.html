		<h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
			<p>Yeah, food is awesome. That's why I starting with food first. (Also because it's first on the website assignment).
			Just saying, I have absolutely no skill in cooking. I just happen to like food.</p>
			<h4>Omelettes</h4>
				<p>Eggs are awesome. Eggs with scrumptious stuff inside are even better. Every time my family stays at a hotel,
				I get omelettes for breakfast. Go eggs-with-stuff-inside! Sometimes I make it myself. It always tastes horrible.</p>

			<h4>Smoothies</h4>
				<p>Actually, it's my little brother who makes smoothies 99% of the time. I just take some. 
				The other 1% of the time I try to follow some online recipe. Those are predictable disasters. </p>

			<h4>Boba Milk Tea</h4>
				<p>Don't try making boba milk tea. There are lots of awesome places to go for boba.
				Try the link below. (It's been a long time since I had boba, so don't count on me to be an expert).</p>

		<h2>An Interesting Movie: The Lego Movie</h2>
			<p>The Lego Movie is an awesome movie, but this section is here mostly to complete the website assignment.</p>
			<h4>Wow, a Synopsis</h4>
				<p>Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary LEGO figurine who always follows the rules, is mistakenly identified as the Special -- an extraordinary being and the key to saving the world. 
				He finds himself drafted into a fellowship of strangers who are on a mission to stop an evil tyrant's (Will Ferrell) plans to conquer the world. 
				Unfortunately for Emmet, he is hopelessly -- and hilariously -- unprepared for such a task, but he'll give it his all nonetheless. </p>
			<h4>Trailer Video</h4>

			<h4>A Personal Review</h4>
				<p>The Lego Movie ranks among my favorites. The plot is very funny and contains many surprising twists and turns.
				Animation is very well done; it looks almost like a homemade stopmotion video (albeit 2 hours long).
				And so concludes my terrible review.</p>

		<h2>Favorite Mathematics Problem: Does P = NP?</h2>
			<p>The P versus NP problem is probably the most important problem in theoretical computer science, and ranks among the top in all areas of mathematics.
			It is one of the seven Millennium Problems, with one million US dollars given to the person(s) who solves one of those problems. To date, only the Poincaré conjecture has been solved. 
			<br>Informally, the P versus NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution that can be quickly verified can also be solved quickly.
			<h4>A Longer Explanation</h4>
				<p>The P versus NP problem concerns how quickly an algorithm can solve a problem given input n. 
				P stands for polynomial time, while NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time.
				<br>A P problem requires at worst x<sup>k</sup> time to solve, where x is "length" of the problem, while k is an integer. Hence the name polynomial time.
				NP problems ARE NOT the hard problems I was talking about. They're any problem whose solution can be verified quickly,
				which obviously includes P problems. NP-hard problems are, well, hard. They require k<sup>x</sup> time to solve (sometimes x!),
				so time grows exponentially as the length of the problem grows. That's really bad.
				<br>The Euler diagram below gives an idea of how the different classes of P and NP are related. (Note: Left side assumes P=NP, right side assumes P≠NP).</p>

			<h4>Additional Resources</h4>
				<p>Please take everything I wrote about the P versus NP problem with a grain of salt. I am not a computer scientist, and don't fully understand the mathematics,
				so I am not very qualified to give a lecture on this topic.

		<h2>Favorite Book: <i>Strange the Dreamer</i></h2>
			<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28449207-strange-the-dreamer"><img src="strange the dreamer cover.jpg" alt="Image failed to load." style="height:300px;width:200px;float:right;border-style:inset;border-color:#C0C0C0;margin:10px;">
            <h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>From Goodreads (click on image for link)</a></p>
			<p><br>The dream chooses the dreamer, not the other way around—and Lazlo Strange, war orphan and junior librarian, has always feared that his dream chose poorly. Since he was five years old he’s been obsessed with the mythic lost city of Weep, but it would take someone bolder than he to cross half the world in search of it. Then a stunning opportunity presents itself, in the person of a hero called the Godslayer and a band of legendary warriors, and he has to seize his chance or lose his dream forever.
			<br>What happened in Weep two hundred years ago to cut it off from the rest of the world? What exactly did the Godslayer slay that went by the name of god? And what is the mysterious problem he now seeks help in solving?
			<br>The answers await in Weep, but so do more mysteries—including the blue-skinned goddess who appears in Lazlo’s dreams. How did he dream her before he knew she existed? And if all the gods are dead, why does she seem so real?</p>
			<h4>Main Character</h4>
				<h5>Lazlo Strange</h5>
					<p>Lazlo is a very Strange person (pun intended). His one and only dream is to see the lost city of Weep,
					but he is only a junior librarian with an intense fascination with fairy tales and magic. However,
					as the book progresses, he becomes more than that.</p>
			<h4>The Pure Joy of Reading</h4>
				<p><i>Strange the Dreamer</i> set itself apart from other books I've read because of the rich, pure emotions it created within me.
				It was impossible to put down. Many times I read past midnight. The language is extremely rich and descriptive, marked by a dreamy quality, yet the book felt real.
				I wanted it to be real. The plot is very well woven, never becoming predictable or boring in any way.
				Honestly, I cannot accurately describe how intense and emotional <i>Strange the Dreamer is</i>. Please, go read it for yourself.
