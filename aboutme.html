	<p> Hello there! My name is Paul Zhang. I attend Canyon Crest Academy as a freshman. Learning is a passion for me.
		Any topic is interesting to me, but I particularly like math and biology. I also play the piano and swim,
		although I am not particularly good at either. Maintaining a sense of humor at all times is another
		one of my traits. Bad puns are my lifeblood. I am also a proud Christian.
