		<h2>Bio of Me!</h2>
			<p>Hello there! My name is Paul Zhang. I attend Canyon Crest Academy as a freshman.</p>
			<p>Learning is a passion for me. Any topic is interesting to me, but I particularly like math and biology. 
			I also play the piano and swim, although I am not particularly good at either.</p>
			<p>Maintaining a sense of humor at all times is another one of my traits. Bad puns are my lifeblood.</p>
			<p>I am also a Christian. Very proud of it. My favorite Bible verse happens to be <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CO.12.9.ESV">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a></p>

		<h2>Bio of My Family</h2>
			<h5>Dad</h5>
				<p>Very awesome and easygoing dad. My dad works at Cavium Inc. as a software engineer, and has a massive CLRS Introduction to Algorithms book.</p>
			<h5>Mom</h5>
				<p>Thanks to my mom for being amazing! She is very smart, working as a statistician at a pharmaceutical company somewhere.
				Happens to be the chef for our family. Has published a paper in a decent journal.</p>
			<h5>Older Sister</h5>
				<p>Currently goes to UC Berkeley. Another intelligent member of our family, plans to become a nurse. Organizes a lot of stuff
				for our family and her food is better than mom's.</p>
			<h5>Both Little Brothers</h5>
				<p>Suffice to say, they're annoying. Yep.</p>
			<h4>(Not Actual) Family Events</h4>
				<p>To retain privacy, these pictures are not accurate depictions of what my family has actually done. Also, they're funny.</p>

		<h2>Family Lineage</h2>
			<p>My parents both came from a small city situated on the Yangtze riverbank in China. According to legend, our surname, å¼  (means archer)
			was originally given to the Chinese guy who invented the bow. He was the son of the fifth son of the Yellow Emperor, apparently.
			You can find more information about my family lineage and about that Chinese guy <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/learn/familyinsights/zhang?variant=c">here</a>.</p>
